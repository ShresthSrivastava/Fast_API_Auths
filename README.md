# Fast_API_Auths
The project contains two .py files that showcase the work that was done for production-ready automations. The actual logic is in the VM that cannot be shared, but this shows how the api was authenticated and fetched data from the database, and was used to manipulate the Data using pandas based on the use case, and is sent back to UiPath automation for further processing.
